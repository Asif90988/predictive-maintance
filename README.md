This project uses Apache Spark to build a predictive maintenance model for turbofan engines. The model is trained on the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set, which contains simulated sensor data from turbofan engines. The goal of the project is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of a turbofan engine based on its sensor data, so that maintenance can be scheduled proactively to avoid costly unplanned downtime.

The project includes the following steps:

Data preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to prepare it for training the predictive model.

Model training: The predictive model is trained on the preprocessed data using Apache Spark.

Model evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated on a test set of data, using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).

Model deployment: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a real-world setting to predict the RUL of real turbofan engines based on their sensor data.

This project can be used as a starting point for building predictive maintenance models for other types of equipment and machinery. The code is open source and can be customized and extended as needed.
